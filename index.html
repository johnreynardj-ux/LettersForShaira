Hello shaii

Haha wajud ko ka expect ay nga mag write nasad kog letter nimo I thought dinako maka buhat karon nga year since ni less atong interaction, pero okay rana oy busy man jud na pag college na daghan kayp buhaton, okay rato akong gi send na English version? Ofcourse ai to pero gi revision nako since lain pud no og ai tanan jusmiyo, I try gani nag ai detector 100% human written na haha.

While ga write ko ani naka realize ko na ang mga chats nato kay usahay 1 day apart naa poy 3 months like tag layo jud siya, ikaw man jud dili mo first move:&lt; haha joke since ako namani ofcourse wala rana sa akoa ang mag first move tapos mag chat rakos imo if good mood ka or dili, sayang kayo tong congratulate gift nakos imo ay something came up man jud ato nga day hayst, gusto pa unta nakoo dungangan tong sweater na kay feel nako dili pa enough ang isa pero diba duha man to akong gi hatag?

Haha, mura najud kog gabuhat ani og Essay ay introduction, body og conclusion ing anion nako? Haha jok.

Mag talk about ta karon nganong each md nimo gwapa kayka huhu like if mag md lang ka straight heart react nanas akoa gusto pud biya ko mag ask sa imong picture ay, kada md nimo for safekeeping lang pero wala nalang since that’ll make you uncomfy ata, same pud sa pfp nimo sanaol grabe ka gwapa and don’t say nga dili shaii I don’t lie gwapa jud kayo ka po, I also feel special if mag interact kas akoa.

While I’m scrolling sa tiktok I saw a post that says “What is the reason why you stayed and loved her patiently?” I was about to comment but I think for a moment “what is it really?” it was months ago and I already found my answer, i stayed because loving her felt natural, even when it was hard, I loved her patiently because she was worth waiting for, i loved her patiently because real love isn’t rushed, i stayed because I saw her flaws and still chose her every day, i stayed because my feelings weren’t temporary or fake, they were sincere. Naka realize ko nga ang pag stay nako ug pag love patiently dili diay tungod kay sure ko sa tanan, pero tungod kay tinuod jud akong gibati. Wala ko ni stay kay sayon, ni stay ko kay natural ra kaayo para sa akoa ang pag pili nimo even though lisod. Naka realize ko nga not all love needs to be rushed, usahay kinahanglan ra jud siya ug time ug patience og bisan daghan kog nasayang nga chances, wala ra gihapon ko nag regret kay kabalo ko nga sincere to tanan, dili temporary, dili fake. Mao ra diay to ni stay ko kay gusto nako, og ni love ko patiently kay para sa akoa, worth it man jud ka. 
Now na nakabalo nako sa mga reason nganong ni stay ko, na motivate nakog-ayo nga mag wait sa imo until I accept nako nimo and I hope pag abot ana nga day were both successful na and ready to face the world, also shaii nag order kog knitted hat mag buhat gani unta kog ing ana nah pero wala jud koy talent bisag usaon maong nag order nalang ko, I hope I accept ni nimo pero I know na I accept jud ni nimo kay ihatag kuni pag hatag nimo sa bracelet actually pud 2nd time nako makadawat og things from you, so excited kayko pero I wonder unsaon nimo pag hatag lahi2 rabatag schedule and among schedule pud sa meeting namos club is every fri or sat, huhu karon pa diay ko ka remember katong nag ingon ka nga ihatag nimo imong portrait gusto raba jud nako dawaton do pero wala nalang, since I don’t want you to give me something just because you felt guilty just like that gusto nako ma kuha nako siya through hard work and effort po, actually shaii I want an answer to this question po, do you like being around me? Kay ako man jud if uban ta gakakulbaan ko maka make og mistake, I don’t know sa akong buhaton ani sometimes ga avoid kog eye contact naka come up kog basin pamati nako ato kay too good rakayka paras akoa huhu, nag ask nakog bisag kinsa, even ai shaii turns out I was afraid losing my closeness with you.
So ayaw kabalaka ha shaii, dili ni para mangayo kog tubag karon dayun. Gusto ra jud nako nga kabalo ka unsa ko ka true sa akong feelings, ug unsa ka ka special para sa akoa. Bisan og ga joke2 ko usahay, seryoso ra gihapon akong gibati. Basin someday, mas smooth na ang tanan magkatawa ta, mag istorya ta, ug wala nay kahadlok. Until then, magpadayon ko sa pagka tinuod nako, ug mag enjoy lang ko sa simple nga moments bisan sa  pag chat2 lang. Unta makabalo ka nga ikaw ra jud ang rason nga ganahan ko magpa smile bisan sa gagmay nga butang. 

Happy New Year, Shaii! 🥳✨ I love you, and I hope this year brings you all the happiness you deserve. I can’t wait to make more memories with you even the small ones mean the world to me. (I hope waka na uncomfy sa I love you)

Hello Shaii
This letter may be long, but I hope you’ll read it knowingly that it comes from a place of sincerity and honesty. We’ve shared years of friendship and memories, and even though  the memories are quite short it still memorable for me, also life took us in different directions, there are feelings I never truly learned how to express properly until now.
Writing this was hard for me cause i spent a lot of time thinking about whether I should do this, especially because of our past and the things I learned from it. I want you to know that this letter is not meant to make you uncomfy nor is it meant to expect anything from you. More than anything, it’s simply my way of being honest and respectfully.
As this year comes to an end and a new one begins i realized that some feelings don’t fade just because time passes, i carried them quietly choosing to respect your space while still appreciating you from afar. This letter is my way of finally putting those thoughts into words not to change anything between us, but to be true to myself and to you.
After everything that happened before, I learned how important it is to be more careful not just with words, but with actions and intentions, what we went through taught me a lot about boundaries, patience, and respect. Since then i’ve tried my best to grow as a person even in the quiet moments when you probably never noticed and if you’re wondering while I’m so good at English I’m using translator this is the English version and the original is finish last month, I’m doing it because I want to be formal with you.
There were times when I chose to admire you from a distance instead of stepping too close, like during our junior high prom there was a moment when I wanted to ask you for a dance, i had imagined it in my head, rehearsed it in my heart, but when I saw you with someone else, I realized that sometimes caring also means stepping back. So I went home early that night, not because I was upset with you, but because I didn’t want to interfere with your happiness. That was one of the first moments I understood that liking someone doesn’t always mean acting on it.
Then came Grade 11, when I unexpectedly saw you again while we were taking our ID’s picture. It was such a simple moment yet it stayed with me longer than i expected. You looked calm, and genuinely beautiful in a way that didn’t need effort. That moment reminded me why i admired you not just for how you look, but for the quiet presence you carry. I realized then that my feelings never truly disappeared but they had only learned how to wait.
When we started talking again, I became more mindful, i also made sure to respect your space, your time, and your comfort. Even if conversations were short, I appreciated them. I never expected constant replies or long talks just knowing that I could still talk to you meant a lot to me. Sometimes, caring quietly felt better than risking making you uncomfy again.
In Grade 12, I had this small plan in my heart to give you a flower on your graduation day. It wasn’t meant to be a grand gesture just something simple and sincere. Unfortunately, things didn’t go as planned that day. At first, I felt disappointed, but later I learned to accept it, i told myself that not everything meaningful has to happen right away and maybe some things are meant to wait until the right time.
Now that we’re both in college i still see the same person I’ve admired for years still kind, still funny, still beautiful in ways that go beyond appearance. Even if we don’t talk often, even if I’m usually the one who starts the conversation, i don’t mind, i understand that everyone has their own life, their own priorities. Liking you never felt like a burden to me it felt like a choice I made with patience and understanding.
I guess what I’m trying to say is that my feelings were never loud or demanding. They stayed with me quietly through different chapters of my life, i didn’t hold onto them because I expected something in return but because they felt real and sincere. You became someone I admired not only for who you are but for how you made me want to become better, calmer, and more respectful as a person.
Finally, i want to say the one thing I’ve been holding back for so long. I really, really, really like you, Shaii. It may sound simple maybe even a little silly, but it’s the truth. These feelings are real and they stayed with me longer than I ever expected.
This letter is my way of expressing what I feel, sumo siya paminawon, but writing has always been the only way I know how to show my love-calmly, honestly, and without pressure, and even if nothing changes, even if this stays one-sided I don’t regret it. I would still choose to feel this way because it’s sincere.
I don’t expect anything from you. I just wanted you to know how special you are to me, and how much respect and admiration I carry for you. If someday you read another letter like this from me, know that it comes from the same place from a heart that chose patience, understanding, and honesty.
Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope you achieve the results you want and ill be rooting for you, waiting for you, and helping you throughout hard times, also I pray that you will be healthy and energetic, and please don’t hesitate to choose someone you love and care because you have your own freedom.
